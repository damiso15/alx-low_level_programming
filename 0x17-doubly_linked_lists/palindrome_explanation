To solve this problem, we need to iterate over all possible combinations of three-digit numbers and find the largest palindrome made from their product.

We can start by defining a function to check if a number is a palindrome:

This function takes an integer as input and returns 1 if it is a palindrome, 0 otherwise. It works by reversing the digits of the number and checking if the result is equal to the original number.

Next, we can write the main function to find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers:

This program iterates over all possible combinations of three-digit numbers using two nested loops. For each combination, it computes the product of the two numbers and checks if it is a palindrome using the is_palindrome function. If the product is a palindrome and larger than the current largest palindrome, it updates the value of largest_palindrome.

Finally, the program prints the value of largest_palindrome.

We can compile and run this program with the following commands:
